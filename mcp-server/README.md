# solar-system-db MCP server

An MCP server that exposes the `solar-system-db` SQLite catalogue as a set of
typed tools for AI agents. **For astronomy, not astrology** — no horoscopes,
houses, transits, natal charts, or aspects. Every tool here is grounded in
observational data from NASA/JPL and the IAU Minor Planet Center.

## Install

From the repo root:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -e ./mcp-server
```

(or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): `uv sync` then `uv pip install -e ./mcp-server`).

Make sure `data/solar_system.sqlite` exists — clone has it committed; if you
deleted it, run `python scripts/populate_initial.py` from the repo root.

## Run

```bash
# Local clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue): stdio transport
python mcp-server/server.py

# Remote / network clients: streamable HTTP on port 8002
python mcp-server/server.py --transport http --port 8002

# Legacy SSE
python mcp-server/server.py --transport sse
```

## Claude Desktop config

Add this to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
(or the equivalent location on your OS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "solar-system-db": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/solar-system-db/mcp-server/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "SOLAR_DB_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/solar-system-db/data/solar_system.sqlite"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Type `/` in the chat to confirm the server registered.

## Tools

### Catalog (data-first)

| Tool | One-liner |
|---|---|
| `find_objects` | Flexible filter: type, parent, size, eccentricity, NEO/PHA, named-only. |
| `get_object` | Full record for one object — orbital + physical + visual + sources. |
| `list_moons` | All moons of a given planet or dwarf planet. |
| `list_dwarf_planets` | The 5 IAU dwarf planets (+ candidates with `include_candidates=True`). |
| `list_neos` | Near-Earth Objects, filterable by diameter. |
| `list_periodic_comets` | Numbered comets (P < 200 y). |
| `list_tnos` | Trans-Neptunian objects + centaurs. |
| `get_rings` | Known rings of a given planet. |
| `search` | Fuzzy text search across names / designations / discoverers. |

### Position / ephemeris

| Tool | One-liner |
|---|---|
| `compute_position` | Heliocentric ecliptic (x, y, z) at a given date by two-body Kepler propagation. |
| `next_perihelion` | Next perihelion passage of a periodic body. |

### Reference / discovery

| Tool | One-liner |
|---|---|
| `list_object_types` | Object-type tally — what the catalogue contains. |
| `get_sources` | Upstream sources and last-retrieved timestamps. |
| `get_schema` | Full SQLite DDL — useful for writing your own queries. |
| `get_stats` | Total counts, last build timestamp. |

### Resources

| URI | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `solar-system://schema` | SQLite schema as a resource. |
| `solar-system://catalog-stats` | Catalogue counts + last-refresh timestamp (JSON). |

## Examples

```text
> find me all asteroids larger than 200 km radius with eccentricity < 0.1
[uses find_objects(object_type="asteroid", min_radius_km=200, max_eccentricity=0.1)]

> what moons does Saturn have?
[uses list_moons("Saturn")]

> tell me everything you know about Comet Halley
[uses get_object("1P/Halley")]

> where is Pluto on 2030-01-01?
[uses compute_position("Pluto", "2030-01-01")]
```

## Precision note

The position tools use two-body Kepler propagation — accurate to ~0.1% for the
major planets over decades, less accurate for highly-perturbed minor bodies.
For arcsecond precision and close-approach work, use the
[JPL Horizons API](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/) directly.

## Tests

```bash
cd mcp-server
python -m pytest tests/
```

Smoke tests confirm each tool family is wired up and the shared data-access
layer returns expected counts. Not 100% coverage by design — they're the
breakage-canary, not the spec.
